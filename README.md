## :page_facing_up: Explanation

The project was developed from a test for GCB, which had to develop a website with the pomodoro technique.

The technique consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into 25-minute periods, separated by short breaks.

The project starts with a screen that determines the times. They come with a default of 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of sleep and 3 sessions, however the user can change these values ‚Äã‚Äãwith the increment (Up) and decrement (Up) arrows on the side. Note: There is no way to leave negative values.

After choosing the time, the user must click on the Continue button below. Thus, it will be directed to the future. After the working time, an alarm will sound and you will be directed to the break time. Following the same logic for the pause time, after the alarm the application will identify if there are still left for initial sessions, if yes, it will not redirect to paging. 



## üìÅ Pages

The site consists of X different pages:


- **Page 1: Home page, where the user will set the values.
- **Page 2: Job page, where the job counter will be started.
- **Page 3: Pause Page, where the user will take the pause time.
